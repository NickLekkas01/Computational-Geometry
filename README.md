# Computational Geometry Course Projects

These projects were done by:

- Emmanouil Lykos([ManosL](https://github.com/ManosL))
- Nikolaos Lekkas([NickLekkas01](https://github.com/NickLekkas01))

The projects are the following:

- Exercise 1: Convex Hull algorithms
- Exercise 2: K-NN
- Exercise 3: Voronoi Diagrams
- Final Project: Computational Geometry applications in Clustering which contains implementation of R and R* Tree, an K-Means center initialization algorithm and an new clustering algorithm.
